This post explains how to design and implement RBAC with the [Casbin](https://casbin.org/) library. For SaaS platforms with resource hierarchies and roles that inherit permissions, Casbin is a performant option.

## Introduction to RBAC

RBAC restricts access based on the roles users hold. To see how **hierarchical** RBAC works, we look at Azure’s RBAC and then implement something similar in Casbin.

## Azure’s hierarchical RBAC

![Azure Hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png)

In Azure, the **Owner** role applies at different scopes. If I have **Owner** at the subscription level, I am Owner of all resource groups and resources under that subscription. If I have Owner at a resource group level, I am Owner of all resources in that group.

The image below shows Owner access at the subscription level. ![Subscription Owner](/img/tutorial/subscription-owner.png)

Checking IAM for a resource group under that subscription shows inherited Owner access. ![RG Owner](/img/tutorial/rg-owner.png)

That is how Azure’s RBAC is hierarchical. Many systems use similar hierarchies. In this tutorial we implement a comparable model with Casbin.

## How Casbin works

Understanding Casbin’s building blocks (request, policy, matcher, effect) makes it easier to design and tune your RBAC model.

## What is ACL?

**ACL (Access Control List)** maps users to actions and actions to resources.

### Model definition

A minimal ACL model:

```toml
[request_definition]
r = sub, act, obj

[policy_definition]
p = sub, act, obj

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
```

1. **request_definition** — Defines the request format. E.g. `alice, write, data1` means “Can Alice write data1?”
2. **policy_definition** — Defines the policy format. E.g. a policy `alice, write, data1` grants Alice permission to write data1.
3. **policy_effect** — How multiple matching policies are combined (e.g. allow-override).
4. **matchers** — The condition that must hold: `r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act`.

### Try it in the Casbin editor

Open the [Casbin editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the model above into the Model editor.

Paste the following in the Policy editor:

```csv
p, alice, read, data1
p, bob, write, data2
```

and the following in the Request editor:

```csv
alice, read, data1
```

The result will be:

```text
true
```

## What is RBAC?

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** assigns users to roles; roles have permissions on resources. A request checks whether the user’s role allows the action on the resource.

### Model definition

A simple RBAC model:

```toml
[request_definition]
r = sub, act, obj

[policy_definition]
p = sub, act, obj

[role_definition]
g = _, _
g2 = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && r.obj == p.obj
```

1. **role_definition** — Defines graph relations (e.g. `g` for role–role or user–role). The matcher uses these to resolve roles and permissions.

### Try it in the Casbin editor

Open the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the model above.

Paste the following in the Policy editor:

```csv
p, alice, reader, data1
p, bob, owner, data2

g, reader, read
g, owner, read
g, owner, write
```

and the following in the Request editor:

```csv
alice, read, data1
alice, write, data1
bob, write, data2
bob, read, data2
bob, write, data1
```

The result will be:

```text
true
false
true
true
false
```

### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching

![rbac](/img/tutorial/rbac.png)

The **g** (role-to-action) relation is a graph. In policy it is written as edges, for example:

```csv
g, reader, read
g, owner, read
g, owner, write
```

:::info
**p** is a normal policy (compared with `==`). **g** is a graph relation. You can add more with suffixes: **g2**, **g3**, etc.
:::

## Hierarchical RBAC

In hierarchical RBAC there are multiple **resource types** with inheritance (e.g. Subscription → ResourceGroup). A subscription **sub1** can contain resource groups **rg1**, **rg2**. Similarly, there are subscription-level roles/actions and resource-group-level roles/actions, with inheritance between them. For example, the subscription role **sub-owner** might inherit to the resource-group role **rg-owner**: if I have **sub-owner** on **sub1**, I effectively have **rg-owner** on **rg1** and **rg2**.

### Model definition

A minimal hierarchical RBAC model:

```toml
[request_definition]
r = sub, act, obj

[policy_definition]
p = sub, act, obj

[role_definition]
g = _, _
g2 = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && g(p.act, r.act) && g2(p.obj, r.obj)
```

Here **g** links roles/actions and **g2** links resources (e.g. subscription to resource group).

### Try it in the Casbin editor

Open the [editor](https://casbin.org/editor) and paste the model above.

Paste the following in the Policy editor:

```csv
p, alice, sub-reader, sub1
p, bob, rg-owner, rg2

// subscription role to subscription action mapping
g, sub-reader, sub-read
g, sub-owner, sub-read
g, sub-owner, sub-write

// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping
g, rg-reader, rg-read
g, rg-owner, rg-read
g, rg-owner, rg-write

// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping
g, sub-reader, rg-reader
g, sub-owner, rg-owner

// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping
g2, sub1, rg1
g2, sub2, rg2
```

And paste the following in the Request editor:

```csv
alice, rg-read, rg1
```

The result will be:

```text
true
```

### Visual representation of the RBAC model, policy, and request matching

The **g** edges (role → action, role → role) can be written in policy as:

```csv
// subscription role to subscription action mapping
g, sub-reader, sub-read
g, sub-owner, sub-read
g, sub-owner, sub-write

// resourceGroup role to resourceGroup action mapping
g, rg-reader, rg-read
g, rg-owner, rg-read
g, rg-owner, rg-write

// subscription role to resourceGroup role mapping
g, sub-reader, rg-reader
g, sub-owner, rg-owner
```

The **g2** edges map subscription to resource group:

```csv
// subscription resource to resourceGroup resource mapping
g2, sub1, rg1
g2, sub2, rg2
```

:::info
Casbin evaluates the request against all policies. If at least one policy matches, the result is **true**; otherwise **false**.

## Conclusion

This tutorial showed how ACL, RBAC, and hierarchical RBAC can be expressed in Casbin. In a follow-up, we will implement this in a Spring Boot app and secure APIs with Casbin.
