We have ported Casbin to Node.js: [node-Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/node-casbin).

<!-- truncate -->

**node-Casbin** keeps the same usage and API as other Casbin implementations. Middlewares for Express, Koa2, and Egg.js are available, and a Sequelize storage adapter is included.

We hope it fits your stack. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
