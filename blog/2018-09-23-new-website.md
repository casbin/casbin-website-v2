title: Reworking our Documentation
authors: [hsluoyz]

Today, we migrated Casbin's documentation from GitHub Wiki to ``Docs`` of this website,
which is powered by Docusaurus. Docusaurus provides lots of awesome features like better
Markdown styles, full-text search, versioning, translation.

The documentation is not perfect yet and still needs tuning. The source code is hosted
on GitHub: https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2 .

Any contribution or suggestion is welcome!
