title: Reworking Our Documentation
authors: [hsluoyz]

We have moved Casbin’s documentation from GitHub Wiki to the **Docs** section of this site, powered by Docusaurus. You get better Markdown rendering, full-text search, versioning, and translation.

The docs are still being improved. The site source is on GitHub: https://github.com/casbin/casbin-website-v2

Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
