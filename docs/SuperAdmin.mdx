A **Super Admin** (e.g. `root`) is a subject that bypasses normal policy and always gets allow. You implement it in the **matcher** by adding a condition like `r.sub == "root"`. Example:

```ini
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act || r.sub == "root"
```

The matcher allows the request if either (1) it matches a policy rule, or (2) `r.sub == "root"`. So `root` is never denied. The same pattern works in RBAC, ABAC, or RBAC-with-domains: add `|| r.sub == "root"` (or your superuser name) to the matcher.
