The Super Admin represents the system-wide administrator. This concept can be applied in models such as RBAC, ABAC, and RBAC with domains. Here is a detailed example:

```ini
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act || r.sub == "root"
```

This example demonstrates how Casbin evaluates whether a request matches a policy using the defined `request_definition`, `policy_definition`, `policy_effect`, and `matchers`. The key check is whether the `sub` equals "root". When this condition is true, authorization is granted, allowing the user to perform any action.

Similar to the root user in Linux systems, a user with root privileges can access all files and modify all settings. To grant a subject complete system access, assign it the Super Admin role, which provides unrestricted permissions across the entire system.
