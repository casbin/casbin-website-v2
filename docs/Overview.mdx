Casbin is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library that supports various 
[access control models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control#Access_control_models)
for enforcing authorization across the board.

Enforcing a set of rules is as simple as listing down subjects, objects and the
desired allowed action (or any other format as per your needs) in a **_policy_** file.
This is synonymous across all flows Casbin is used in. The developer/administrator has the 
complete control over the layout, execution and conditions for authorization 
which is set via the **_model_** file. Casbin provides an **_Enforcer_** for 
validating an incoming request based on the policy and model files given to the Enforcer.

### Feature set for different languages

We are always working our best to make Casbin have the same set of features for all 
languages. But the reality is not that beautiful.

only means having the interface in the core library. It is not indicative of whether 
there is a watcher or role manager implementation available.

## What is Casbin?

Casbin is an authorization library which can be used in flows where we want a certain
`object` or entity to be accessed by a specific user or `subject`. The type of access i.e. `action`
can be _read_, _write_, _delete_ or any other action as set by the developer.
This is how Casbin is most widely used and its called the "standard"
or classic `{ subject, object, action }` flow.

Casbin is capable of handling many complex authorization senerios other than the standard flow.
There can be addition of [roles (RBAC)](/docs/rbac), [attributes (ABAC)](/docs/abac) etc.

### What Casbin does:

1. Enforce the policy in the classic ``{ subject, object, action }`` form 
    or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.
2. Handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.
3. Manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC).
4. Support built-in superuser like ``root`` or ``administrator``. A superuser can do anything without explicit permissions.
5. Multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, ``keyMatch`` can map a 
    resource key ``/foo/bar`` to the pattern ``/foo*``.

### What Casbin does **NOT** do:

1. Authentication (aka verify ``username`` and ``password`` when a user logs in)
2. Manage the list of users or roles.

It's more convenient for the project to manage their list of users, roles or passwords.
Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container.
However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario.
