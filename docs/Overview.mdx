Casbin is an efficient, open-source access control library designed to enforce authorization through support for multiple [access control models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control#Access_control_models).

Implementing rule-based access control is straightforward: define subjects, objects, and permitted actions in a **_policy_** file using any format that suits your requirements. This pattern remains consistent throughout all Casbin implementations. Through the **_model_** file, developers and administrators maintain full authority over authorization logic, including layout, execution flow, and conditional requirements. To validate incoming requests against your defined policy and model files, Casbin provides an **_Enforcer_** component.

### Feature Set for Different Languages

Our goal is feature parity across all language implementations, though we haven't achieved complete uniformity yet.

## What is Casbin?

Casbin serves as an authorization library for scenarios requiring controlled access to resources. In typical usage, a `subject` (user or service) requests access to an `object` (resource or entity) to perform an `action` (such as _read_, _write_, or _delete_). Developers define these actions according to their application needs. This represents the "standard" or classic `{ subject, object, action }` authorization flow that Casbin handles most commonly.

Beyond this standard model, Casbin accommodates complex authorization scenarios by supporting [roles (RBAC)](/docs/rbac), [attributes (ABAC)](/docs/abac), and other advanced patterns.

### What Casbin Does

1. Applies policy enforcement in the classic ``{ subject, object, action }`` format or any custom format you define, supporting both allow and deny authorizations.
2. Manages storage for the access control model and associated policies.
3. Handles user-role and role-role relationships (the role hierarchy concept in RBAC).
4. Recognizes built-in superusers such as ``root`` or ``administrator`` who have unrestricted access without requiring explicit permission rules.
5. Supplies various built-in operators for pattern matching in rules—for instance, ``keyMatch`` matches resource key ``/foo/bar`` to pattern ``/foo*``.

### What Casbin Does **NOT** Do

1. User authentication (validating ``username`` and ``password`` credentials during login)
2. User or role list management

Most applications already manage their own user accounts, roles, and credentials. Casbin wasn't designed as a password storage system—it focuses solely on authorization. That said, Casbin does maintain user-role associations when operating in RBAC mode.
