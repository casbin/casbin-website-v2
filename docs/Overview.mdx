Casbin is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library that supports various
[access control models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control#Access_control_models)
for enforcing authorization across the board.

Enforcing a set of rules is as simple as listing subjects, objects, and the desired allowed actions (or any other format according to your needs) in a **_policy_** file. This approach is consistent across all flows where Casbin is used. The developer or administrator has complete control over the layout, execution, and conditions for authorization through the **_model_** file. Casbin provides an **_Enforcer_** to validate incoming requests based on the policy and model files.

### Feature Set for Different Languages

We are always working to ensure Casbin has the same set of features across all
languages. However, the reality is not quite there yet.

## What is Casbin?

Casbin is an authorization library used to control access when a specific user or `subject` needs to access a certain
`object` or entity. The type of access, i.e., the `action`,
can be _read_, _write_, _delete_, or any other action defined by the developer. This is how Casbin is most widely used, and it's called the "standard"
or classic `{ subject, object, action }` flow.

Casbin is capable of handling many complex authorization scenarios other than the standard flow. There can be the addition of [roles (RBAC)](/docs/rbac), [attributes (ABAC)](/docs/abac), etc.

### What Casbin Does

1. Enforce policies in the classic ``{ subject, object, action }`` form or a customized form as you define. Both allow and deny authorizations are supported.
2. Handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.
3. Manage role-user mappings and role-role mappings (also known as role hierarchy in RBAC).
4. Support built-in superusers like ``root`` or ``administrator``. A superuser can perform any action without explicit permissions.
5. Provide multiple built-in operators for rule matching. For example, ``keyMatch`` can map a resource key ``/foo/bar`` to the pattern ``/foo*``.

### What Casbin Does **NOT** Do

1. Authentication (i.e., verifying ``username`` and ``password`` when a user logs in)
2. Manage the list of users or roles.

It's more convenient for projects to manage their own lists of users, roles, or passwords. Users typically have their own passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin does store user-role mappings for RBAC scenarios.
