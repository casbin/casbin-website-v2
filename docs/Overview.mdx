Casbin is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library that supports various
[access control models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control#Access_control_models)
for enforcing authorization across the board.

Enforcing access control rules is as simple as listing subjects, objects, and permitted actions (or custom formats) in a **_policy_** file. This pattern is consistent across all Casbin usage scenarios. Developers/administrators maintain full control over authorization logic, including rule structure, execution flow, and conditional checks, through the **_model_** file. Casbin provides an **_Enforcer_** for validating an incoming request based on the policy and model files given to the Enforcer.

### Feature Set for Different Languages

We are always working our best to make Casbin have the same set of features for all
languages. However, the reality is not that beautiful.

## What is Casbin?

Casbin is an authorization library for controlling access to resources (objects) by users (subjects) through specific operations (actions). Common actions include _read_, _write_, and _delete_, though developers can define custom actions. This fundamental usage pattern is known as the classic `{ subject, object, action }` authorization flow.

Casbin is capable of handling many complex authorization scenarios other than the standard flow. There can be the addition of [roles (RBAC)](/docs/rbac), [attributes (ABAC)](/docs/abac), etc.

### What Casbin Does

1. Enforce the policy in the classic ``{ subject, object, action }`` form or a customized form as you defined. Both allow and deny authorizations are supported.
2. Handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.
3. Manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC).
4. Support built-in superusers like ``root`` or ``administrator``. A superuser can do anything without explicit permissions.
5. Provide multiple built-in operators to support rule matching. For example, ``keyMatch`` can map a resource key ``/foo/bar`` to the pattern ``/foo*``.

### What Casbin Does **NOT** Do

1. Authentication (aka verifying ``username`` and ``password`` when a user logs in)
2. Manage the list of users or roles.

It's more convenient for projects to manage their lists of users, roles, or passwords. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario.
