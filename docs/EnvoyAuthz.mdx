[Envoy-authz](https://github.com/casbin/envoy-authz) is a middleware for Envoy that performs external RBAC & ABAC authorization using Casbin. This middleware leverages [Envoy's external authorization API](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/ext_authz_filter.html) via a gRPC server. The proxy can be deployed on any Envoy-based service mesh, such as Istio.

## Requirements

- Envoy 1.17+
- Istio or any other service mesh
- gRPC dependencies

Dependencies are managed using `go.mod`.

## How the Middleware Works

- A client makes an HTTP request.
- The Envoy proxy sends the request to the gRPC server.
- The gRPC server authorizes the request based on Casbin policies.
- If authorized, the request is forwarded; otherwise, it is denied.

The gRPC server is based on the protocol buffer from [external_auth.proto](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/api/envoy/service/auth/v2alpha/external_auth.proto) in Envoy.

```protobuf
// A generic interface for performing authorization checks on incoming
// requests to a networked service.
service Authorization {
  // Performs an authorization check based on the attributes associated with the
  // incoming request and returns a status of `OK` or not `OK`.
  rpc Check(v2.CheckRequest) returns (v2.CheckResponse);
}
```

From the above proto file, the `Check()` service is used in the authorization server.

## Usage

- Define Casbin policies in the config files following this [guide](/docs/how-it-works).

You can verify or test your policies using the online [casbin-editor](/editor).

- Start the authentication server by running:

```bash
go build .
./authz
```

- Load the Envoy configuration:

```bash
envoy -c authz.yaml -l info
```

Once Envoy starts, it will intercept requests for the authorization process.

## Integrating with Istio

To make this middleware work, you need to send custom headers containing usernames in the JWT token or headers. Refer to the official [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/v1.4/docs/tasks/policy-enforcement/control-headers/) for more information on modifying `Request Headers`.
