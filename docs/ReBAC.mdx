## What is the ReBAC Model?

ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control) is a contemporary access control model that manages permissions based on relationships between entities. Unlike traditional models such as RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control), ReBAC excels in systems with intricate relationship networks, including social networks, collaborative platforms, and multi-tenant environments.

In ReBAC, authorization decisions depend on the relationships between entities, for example:

- Is the user the "owner" of the resource?
- Is the user a "friend" of the resource's "creator"?
- Does the user belong to an organization associated with the resource?
- Is the user an "admin" of a specific "project"?

These relationships are typically represented as graph structures or paths.

## ReBAC Support in Casbin

Casbin supports ReBAC through the following mechanisms:

- User-Resource-Role Relationships
- Resource-Type Relationships

A single policy rule can apply to multiple users and multiple resources of the same type, enabling flexible and scalable permission control through relationship combinations.

Casbin uses `.conf` files to define access control models. Here is an official ReBAC model example:

```ini
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
p = role, obj_type, act

[role_definition]
g = _, _, _
g2 = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = g(r.sub, r.obj, p.role) && g2(r.obj, p.obj_type) && r.act == p.act
```

```csv
# Permission definition: The "collaborator" role can read files of type "doc"
p, collaborator, doc, read

# User-Resource-Role Relationship: alice is a collaborator of doc1
g, alice, doc1, collaborator

# Resource-Type Relationship: doc1 is of type "doc"
g2, doc1, doc
```

Permissions are automatically derived by verifying that a user has a specific role for a resource and that the resource belongs to the specified type, combining **role relationships + type relationships + permission definitions**.
