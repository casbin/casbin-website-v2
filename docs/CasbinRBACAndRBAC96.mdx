## Casbin RBAC and RBAC96

This page compares Casbin’s RBAC with the [RBAC96](https://profsandhu.com/cs6393_s12/lecture-rbac96.pdf) model. Casbin supports the main RBAC96 ideas and adds domains and flexible permissions.

| RBAC96 | Casbin support | Notes |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **RBAC0** | ✅ Full | Users, roles, permissions and their relationships. |
| **RBAC1** | ✅ Full | Role hierarchy (e.g. alice→role1→role2). |
| **RBAC2** | ⚠️ Partial | Constraint-style handling (e.g. deny-override) via [policy effect](/docs/syntax-for-models#policy-effect). No quantitative limits. |
| **RBAC3** | ⚠️ Partial | RBAC1 + RBAC2; constraints as above, no quantitative limits. |

## Differences from RBAC96

### 1. User vs. role

Casbin does not separate “user” and “role” in the type system—both are strings. So:

   ```csv
   p, admin, book, read
   p, alice, book, read
   g, amber, admin
   ```

   `GetAllSubjects()` returns both users and roles that appear as subjects in policy (`[admin alice]`). `GetAllRoles()` returns only the right-hand side of `g` rules (`[admin]`). So Casbin infers the distinction from usage; for strict separation use a naming convention (e.g. `user::alice`, `role::admin`).

### 2. Permissions

RBAC96 fixes seven permission types. In Casbin, permissions are arbitrary strings (e.g. `read`, `write`, `approve`), so you can match your app.

### 3. Domains

Casbin supports [RBAC with domains](/docs/rbac-with-domains), so roles and permissions can be scoped per tenant or domain—beyond the standard RBAC96 model.
