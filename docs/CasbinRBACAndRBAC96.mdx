## Casbin RBAC and RBAC96

This document compares Casbin RBAC with [RBAC96](https://profsandhu.com/cs6393_s12/lecture-rbac96.pdf).

Casbin RBAC implements nearly all RBAC96 features while adding enhancements.

| RBAC Version | Support Level | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| RBAC0        | Fully Supported | RBAC0 provides basic RBAC96 functionality, defining relationships between Users, Roles, and Permissions. |
| RBAC1        | Fully Supported | RBAC1 extends RBAC0 with role hierarchies. When `alice` has `role1` and `role1` has `role2`, then `alice` inherits `role2` and its permissions. |
| RBAC2        | Mutually Exclusive Handling Supported ([like this](/docs/syntax-for-models#policy-effect)) | RBAC2 adds constraints to RBAC0, enabling mutually exclusive policy handling. Quantitative limits are unsupported. |
| RBAC3        | Mutually Exclusive Handling Supported ([like this](/docs/syntax-for-models#policy-effect)) | RBAC3 combines RBAC1 and RBAC2, supporting both role hierarchies and constraints. Quantitative limits are unsupported. |

## The Difference Between Casbin RBAC and RBAC96

1. Casbin blurs the User-Role distinction compared to RBAC96.

   Casbin treats both Users and Roles as strings. Consider this policy:

   ```csv
   p, admin, book, read
   p, alice, book, read
   g, amber, admin
   ```

   Calling `GetAllSubjects()` on a Casbin Enforcer:

   ```go
   e.GetAllSubjects()
   ```

   returns:

   ```go
   [admin alice]
   ```

   Casbin includes both Users and Roles as subjects.

   However, calling `GetAllRoles()`:

   ```go
   e.GetAllRoles()
   ```

   returns:

   ```go
   [admin]
   ```

   Casbin distinguishes Users from Roles, but less strictly than RBAC96. Add prefixes like `user::alice` and `role::admin` to clarify relationships.

2. Casbin RBAC offers more flexible permissions than RBAC96.

   RBAC96 defines seven permissions: read, write, append, execute, credit, debit, and inquiry.

   Casbin treats permissions as strings, letting you define permissions matching your requirements.

3. Casbin RBAC supports domains.

   Casbin enables domain-based authorization, providing greater Access Control Model flexibility.
