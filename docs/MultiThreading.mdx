When using Casbin in a multi-threaded environment, you can use the synchronized wrapper of the Casbin enforcer: [enforcer_synced.go](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/enforcer_synced.go) (Go) and [enforcer_synced.cpp](https://github.com/casbin/casbin-cpp/blob/master/casbin/enforcer_synced.cpp) (C++).

It also supports the "AutoLoad" feature, allowing the Casbin enforcer to automatically load the latest policy rules from the database if any changes occur. To start automatic loading of policies periodically, call the `StartAutoLoadPolicy()` function. To stop automatic loading, call the `StopAutoLoadPolicy()` function.
