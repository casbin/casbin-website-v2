For multi-threaded environments, use the synchronized wrapper provided by Casbin: [enforcer_synced.go](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/enforcer_synced.go) (GoLang) and [enforcer_synced.cpp](https://github.com/casbin/casbin-cpp/blob/master/casbin/enforcer_synced.cpp) (C++).

The synchronized enforcer also supports automatic policy reloading. This feature monitors the policy source for changes and reloads policies automatically when updates are detected. Call `StartAutoLoadPolicy()` to enable periodic policy reloading, and call `StopAutoLoadPolicy()` to disable it.
