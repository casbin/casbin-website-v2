## Overview

**Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** means the system enforces access rules that users cannot bypass. Policy is central and uniform; access is determined by **labels** (e.g. clearance, classification) rather than by user choice.

## MAC models in Casbin

Casbin provides:

- **[BLP](/docs/blp)** — Confidentiality: “no read up, no write down”
- **[Biba](/docs/biba)** — Integrity: “no read down, no write up”
- **[LBAC](/docs/lbac)** — Lattice-based: both confidentiality and integrity in one model

## Shared properties

- **Central policy** — Rules are system-wide, not per user.
- **Labels** — Subjects and objects have security/integrity levels.
- **Formal rules** — Each model encodes specific guarantees (e.g. no information flow upward in BLP).

## When to use MAC

- Government, military, or regulated environments with classification levels
- Systems where data integrity is as important as confidentiality
- Multi-level security (MLS) deployments

See the linked pages for each model’s syntax and examples.
