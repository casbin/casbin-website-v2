## Overview

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a type of access control where the operating system or security kernel constrains the ability of a subject to access or perform operations on an object. In MAC systems, security policies are centrally controlled and cannot be changed by individual users.

## MAC Models in Casbin

Casbin supports several well-known MAC security models:

- **BLP (Bell-LaPadula)**: A formal state transition model focusing on confidentiality
- **Biba**: An integrity-focused model that prevents unauthorized data modification
- **LBAC (Lattice-Based Access Control)**: A formal model that can combine confidentiality and integrity controls

## Key Characteristics

MAC models share several important characteristics:

- **Centralized Policy Management**: Security policies are defined and enforced by the system
- **Security Labels**: Objects and subjects are assigned security labels or clearance levels
- **Formal Security Properties**: Each model enforces specific security properties (e.g., no read up, no write down)

## Use Cases

MAC models are particularly useful in:

- Government and military systems requiring strict confidentiality
- Systems requiring strong data integrity guarantees
- Multi-level security environments

Explore the subsections in this category to learn more about each MAC model and how to implement them in Casbin.
