You can run Casbin as a **remote service** and call it via gRPC or HTTP instead of embedding the library. Options:

| Project | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| [Casbin Server](https://github.com/casbin/casbin-server) | Official gRPC service exposing Management API and RBAC API. |
| [middleware-acl](https://github.com/luk4z7/middleware-acl) | RESTful ACL middleware built on Casbin. |
| [auth-server](https://github.com/ZettaAI/auth-server) | Auth server example using Casbin. |
