You can also use the [online editor](/editor) to write your Casbin model and policy in your web browser. It provides functionality such as "syntax highlighting" and "code completion", just like an IDE for a programming language.

## Use Custom Functions

If you need to use a customized matching function (e.g. "RBAC with Patterns"), you can add it by clicking the "Add Role Matching" button at the bottom left corner of the editor.

![editor-tips](/img/editor-tips.png).

If you want to write the equivalent code, you need to specify the pattern matching function through the relevant API. Refer to [RBAC with Pattern](/docs/rbac-with-pattern) for more information.

:::note

The editor supports multiple Casbin implementations, including [Node-Casbin (Node.js)](https://github.com/casbin/node-casbin), [JCasbin (Java)](https://github.com/casbin/jcasbin), [Casbin (Go)](https://github.com/casbin/casbin), [Casbin-rs (Rust)](https://github.com/casbin/casbin-rs), [PyCasbin (Python)](https://github.com/casbin/pycasbin), and [Casbin.NET (C#)](https://github.com/casbin/Casbin.NET). You can switch between different implementations in the upper right corner to test your model and policy.

Although the editor validates through a remote CLI, due to environment differences, the validation results may differ slightly from the results you get in your local environment. If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the corresponding Casbin implementation repository.
