### Use Custom Functions

Add custom matching functions (for example, "RBAC with Patterns") by clicking the "Add Role Matching" button in the bottom left corner.

To implement custom matching functions in your code, configure them through the Casbin API. See [RBAC with Pattern](/docs/rbac-with-pattern) for details.

:::note

The editor supports [Node-Casbin (Node.js)](https://github.com/casbin/node-casbin), [JCasbin (Java)](https://github.com/casbin/jcasbin), [Casbin (Go)](https://github.com/casbin/casbin), [Casbin-rs (Rust)](https://github.com/casbin/casbin-rs), [PyCasbin (Python)](https://github.com/casbin/pycasbin), and [Casbin.NET (C#)](https://github.com/casbin/Casbin.NET). Switch between implementations in the upper right corner to test your configuration.

The editor validates models through a remote CLI. Results may vary slightly from your local environment due to implementation differences. Report any issues to the appropriate Casbin implementation repository.
