The `Effect` represents the result of a policy rule, and the `Effector` is the interface for handling effects in Casbin.

## `MergeEffects()`

The `MergeEffects()` function is used to merge all matching results collected by the enforcer into a single decision.

For example:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="langs">
<TabItem value="Go" label="Go" default>
```

```go
Effect, explainIndex, err = e.MergeEffects(expr, effects, matches, policyIndex, policyLength)
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

In this example:  

- `Effect` is the final decision that is merged by this function (initialized as `Indeterminate`).
- `explainIndex` is the index of `eft` (`Allow` or `Deny`), and it is initialized as `-1`.
- `err` is used to check if the effect is supported.
- `expr` is the string representation of the policy effects.
- `effects` is an array of effects, which can be `Allow`, `Indeterminate`, or `Deny`.
- `matches` is an array that indicates whether the result matches the policy.
- `policyIndex` is the index of the policy in the model.
- `policyLength` is the length of the policy.

The code above illustrates how to pass the parameters to the `MergeEffects()` function, and the function will process the effects and matches based on the `expr`.

To use the `Effector`, follow these steps:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="langs">
<TabItem value="Go" label="Go" default>
```

```go
var e Effector
Effect, explainIndex, err = e.MergeEffects(expr, effects, matches, policyIndex, policyLength)
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

The basic idea of `MergeEffects()` is that if the `expr` can match the results, indicating that the `p_eft` is `allow`, then all effects can be merged. If no deny rules are matched, then the decision is allow.

:::note

If the `expr` does not match the condition `"priority(p_eft) || deny"`, and the `policyIndex` is shorter than `policyLength-1`, it will **short-circuit** some effects in the middle.
