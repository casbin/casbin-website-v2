## Role Definition with Domain Tenants

The RBAC roles in Casbin can be global or domain-specific. Domain-specific roles mean that the roles for a user can be different when the user is in different domains/tenants. This is very useful for large systems like a cloud, as users are usually in different tenants.

The role definition with domains/tenants should look like this:

```ini
[role_definition]
g = _, _, _
```

The third `_` represents the name of the domain/tenant, and this part should not be changed. Then the policy can be:

```csv
p, admin, tenant1, data1, read
p, admin, tenant2, data2, read

g, alice, admin, tenant1
g, alice, user, tenant2
```

This means that the `admin` role in `tenant1` can read `data1`. And `alice` has the `admin` role in `tenant1` and the `user` role in `tenant2`. Therefore, she can read `data1`. However, since `alice` is not an `admin` in `tenant2`, she cannot read `data2`.

Then, in a matcher, you should check the role as follows:

```ini
[matchers]
m = g(r.sub, p.sub, r.dom) && r.dom == p.dom && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
```

Please refer to the [rbac_with_domains_model.conf](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/examples/rbac_with_domains_model.conf) for examples.

:::info Token Name Convention

Note: Conventionally, the domain token name in policy definition is `dom` and is placed as the second token (`sub, dom, obj, act`).
Now, Golang Casbin supports customized token names and placement. If the domain token name is `dom`, the domain token can be placed at an arbitrary position without any additional action. If the domain token name is not `dom`, `e.SetFieldIndex()` for `constant.DomainIndex` should be called after the enforcer is initialized, regardless of its position.

```ini
# `domain` here for `dom`
[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act, domain
```

```go
e.SetFieldIndex("p", constant.DomainIndex, 3) // index starts from 0
users := e.GetAllUsersByDomain("domain1") // without SetFieldIndex, it will raise an error
```
