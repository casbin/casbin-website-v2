## What is the ReBAC Model?

ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control) is a modern access control model that focuses on relationships between entities for permission management. Compared to traditional RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control), ReBAC is better suited for systems with complex relationship networks, such as social networks, collaboration platforms, and multi-tenant systems.

In ReBAC, authorization decisions are based on relationships between entities, such as:

- Is the user the "owner" of the resource?
- Is the user a "friend" of the resource's "creator"?
- Does the user belong to an organization associated with the resource?
- Is the user an "admin" of a certain "project"?

These relationships are typically modeled as graph structures or paths.

## ReBAC Support in Casbin

Casbin provides the following mechanisms to implement ReBAC:

- User-Resource-Role Relationships
- Resource-Type Relationships

A single policy rule can cover multiple users and multiple resources of the same type, enabling flexible and scalable permission control through relationship combinations.

Casbin uses `.conf` files to define access control models. Below is an official ReBAC model example:

```ini
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
p = role, obj_type, act

[role_definition]
g = _, _, _
g2 = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = g(r.sub, r.obj, p.role) && g2(r.obj, p.obj_type) && r.act == p.act
```

```csv
# Permission definition: The "collaborator" role can read files of type "doc"
p, collaborator, doc, read

# User-Resource-Role Relationship: alice is a collaborator of doc1
g, alice, doc1, collaborator

# Resource-Type Relationship: doc1 is of type "doc"
g2, doc1, doc
```

By checking whether a user has a specific role for a given resource and whether the resource belongs to a specified type, permissions are automatically derived through **role relationships + type relationships + permission definitions**.
