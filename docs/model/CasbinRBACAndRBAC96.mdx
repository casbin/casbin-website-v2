## Casbin RBAC and RBAC96

In this document, we will compare Casbin RBAC with [RBAC96](https://profsandhu.com/cs6393_s12/lecture-rbac96.pdf).

Casbin RBAC supports nearly all the features of RBAC96 and adds new features on top of that.

| RBAC Version | Support Level | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| RBAC0        | Fully Supported | RBAC0 is the basic version of RBAC96. It clarifies the relationship between Users, Roles, and Permissions. |
| RBAC1        | Fully Supported | RBAC1 adds role hierarchies on top of RBAC0. This means that if `alice` has `role1`, `role1` has `role2`, then `alice` will also have `role2` and inherit its permissions. |
| RBAC2        | Mutually Exclusive Handling Supported ([like this](/docs/syntax-for-models#policy-effect)) | RBAC2 adds constraints on RBAC0. This allows RBAC2 to handle mutually exclusive policies. However, quantitative limits are not supported. |
| RBAC3        | Mutually Exclusive Handling Supported ([like this](/docs/syntax-for-models#policy-effect)) | RBAC3 is a combination of RBAC1 and RBAC2. It supports role hierarchies and constraints found in RBAC1 and RBAC2. However, quantitative limits are not supported. |

## The Difference Between Casbin RBAC and RBAC96

1. In Casbin, the distinction between User and Role is not as clear as in RBAC96.

   In Casbin, both the User and the Role are treated as strings. For example, consider the following policy file:

   ```csv
   p, admin, book, read
   p, alice, book, read
   g, amber, admin
   ```

   If you call the method `GetAllSubjects()` using an instance of the Casbin Enforcer:

   ```go
   e.GetAllSubjects()
   ```

   the return value will be:

   ```go
   [admin alice]
   ```

   This is because in Casbin, subjects include both Users and Roles.

   However, if you call the method `GetAllRoles()`:

   ```go
   e.GetAllRoles()
   ```

   the return value will be:

   ```go
   [admin]
   ```

   From this, you can see that there is a distinction between Users and Roles in Casbin, but it is not as sharp as in RBAC96. Of course, you can add a prefix to your policies such as `user::alice` and `role::admin` to clarify their relationships.

2. Casbin RBAC provides more permissions than RBAC96.

   RBAC96 defines only 7 permissions: read, write, append, execute, credit, debit, and inquiry.

   However, in Casbin, we treat permissions as strings. This allows you to create permissions that better suit your needs.

3. Casbin RBAC supports domains.

   In Casbin, you can perform authorizations based on domains. This feature makes your Access Control Model more flexible.
