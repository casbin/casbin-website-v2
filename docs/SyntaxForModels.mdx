- A model configuration (CONF) should have at least four sections: `[request_definition]`, `[policy_definition]`, `[policy_effect]`, and `[matchers]`.

- If a model uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), it should also include the `[role_definition]` section.

- If a model needs to enforce policy invariants for RBAC, it can optionally include the `[constraint_definition]` section.

- A model configuration (CONF) can contain comments. Comments start with the `#` symbol, and everything after the `#` symbol will be commented out.

## Request definition

The `[request_definition]` section defines the arguments in the `e.Enforce(...)` function.

```ini
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act
```

In this example, `sub`, `obj`, and `act` represent the classic access triple: the subject (accessing entity), the object (accessed resource), and the action (access method). However, you can customize your own request format. For example, you can use `sub, act` if you don't need to specify a particular resource, or `sub, sub2, obj, act` if you have two accessing entities.

## Policy Definition

The `[policy_definition]` is the definition for a policy. It defines the meaning of the policy. For example, we have the following model:

```ini
[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act
p2 = sub, act
```

And we have the following policy (if in a policy file):

```csv
p, alice, data1, read
p2, bob, write-all-objects
```

Each line in a policy is called a policy rule. Each policy rule starts with a `policy type`, such as `p` or `p2`. It is used to match the policy definition if there are multiple definitions. The above policy shows the following binding. The binding can be used in the matcher.

```text
(alice, data1, read) -> (p.sub, p.obj, p.act)
(bob, write-all-objects) -> (p2.sub, p2.act)
```

:::tip

The elements in a policy rule are always regarded as `strings`. If you have any questions about this, please refer to the discussion at: [https://github.com/casbin/casbin/issues/113](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/issues/113)

:::

## Policy Effect

``[policy_effect]`` is the definition for the policy effect. It determines whether the access request should be approved if multiple policy rules match the request. For example, one rule permits and the other denies.

```ini
[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))
```

The above policy effect means that if there's any matched policy rule of ``allow``, the final effect is ``allow`` (also known as allow-override). ``p.eft`` is the effect for a policy, and it can be either ``allow`` or ``deny``. It is optional, and the default value is ``allow``. Since we didn't specify it above, it uses the default value.

Another example for the policy effect is:

```ini
[policy_effect]
e = !some(where (p.eft == deny))
```

This means that if there are no matched policy rules of ``deny``, the final effect is ``allow`` (also known as deny-override). ``some`` means that there exists one matched policy rule. ``any`` means that all matched policy rules (not used here). The policy effect can even be connected with logical expressions:

```ini
[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow)) && !some(where (p.eft == deny))
```

This means that there must be at least one matched policy rule of ``allow``, and there cannot be any matched policy rule of ``deny``. Therefore, in this way, both allow and deny authorizations are supported, and the deny overrides.

:::note

Although we designed the syntax of the policy effect as above, the current implementations only use hard-coded policy effects. This is because we found that there isn't much need for that level of flexibility. So for now, you must use one of the built-in policy effects instead of customizing your own.

:::

The supported built-in policy effects are:

| Policy Effect                                                | Meaning               | Example                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| some(where (p.eft == allow))                                 | allow-override        | [ACL, RBAC, etc.](/docs/supported-models#examples)  |
| !some(where (p.eft == deny))                                 | deny-override         | [Deny-override](/docs/supported-models#examples)    |

| subjectPriority(p.eft)                                       | priority based on role| [Subject-Priority](/docs/supported-models#examples) |

## Constraint Definition

The `[constraint_definition]` section declares policy invariants for RBAC systems. Constraints ensure your role assignments stay valid by checking rules every time policies change. This section is optional and only works when RBAC is enabled (requires `[role_definition]`).

```ini
[constraint_definition]
c = sod("finance_requester", "finance_approver")
c2 = sodMax(["payroll_view", "payroll_edit", "payroll_approve"], 1)
c3 = roleMax("superadmin", 2)
c4 = rolePre("db_admin", "security_trained")
```

### Constraint Types

**Separation of Duties (sod)** - Prevents a user from holding two conflicting roles simultaneously. When Alice is assigned `finance_requester`, the system blocks any attempt to also give her `finance_approver`.

```ini
c = sod("finance_requester", "finance_approver")
```

**Separation of Duties Max (sodMax)** - Limits how many roles from a set each user can have. With `sodMax` set to 1, a user managing payroll can either view, edit, or approve—but never hold two of these roles at once.

```ini
c2 = sodMax(["payroll_view", "payroll_edit", "payroll_approve"], 1)
```

**Role Cardinality (roleMax)** - Caps the total number of users who can have a specific role. Setting a limit of 2 for `superadmin` means only two people in your organization can hold that role at any time.

```ini
c3 = roleMax("superadmin", 2)
```

**Prerequisite Role (rolePre)** - Requires users to have one role before they can receive another. Nobody gets `db_admin` access unless they already have the `security_trained` role.

```ini
c4 = rolePre("db_admin", "security_trained")
```

### How Constraints Work

Constraints validate automatically when you modify grouping policies through methods like `AddGroupingPolicy()` or `RemoveGroupingPolicy()`. If a change would break a constraint, the operation fails and returns a constraint violation error—the policy remains unchanged.

During model initialization, all existing constraints are checked against current policies. If any constraint is invalid (wrong syntax, missing RBAC setup, or violated by existing data), the model fails to load with a descriptive error.

## Matchers

``[matchers]`` is the definition for policy matchers. The matchers are expressions that define how the policy rules are evaluated against the request.

```ini
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
```

The above matcher is the simplest and means that the subject, object, and action in a request should match the ones in a policy rule.

Arithmetic operators like ``+, -, *, /`` and logical operators like ``&&, ||, !`` can be used in matchers.

### Order of expressions in matchers

The order of expressions can greatly affect performance. Take a look at the following example for more details:

```go
const rbac_models = `
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

[role_definition]
g = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = g(r.sub, p.sub) && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
`

func TestManyRoles(t *testing.T) {

    m, _ := model.NewModelFromString(rbac_models)
    e, _ := NewEnforcer(m, false)

    roles := []string{"admin", "manager", "developer", "tester"}

    // 2500 projects
    for nbPrj := 1; nbPrj < 2500; nbPrj++ {
        // 4 objects and 1 role per object (so 4 roles)
        for _, role := range roles {
            roleDB := fmt.Sprintf("%s_project:%d", role, nbPrj)
            objectDB := fmt.Sprintf("/projects/%d", nbPrj)
            e.AddPolicy(roleDB, objectDB, "GET")
        }
        jasmineRole := fmt.Sprintf("%s_project:%d", roles[1], nbPrj)
        e.AddGroupingPolicy("jasmine", jasmineRole)
    }

    e.AddGroupingPolicy("abu", "manager_project:1")
    e.AddGroupingPolicy("abu", "manager_project:2499")

    // With same number of policies
    // User 'abu' has only two roles
    // User 'jasmine' has many roles (1 role per policy, here 2500 roles)

    request := func(subject, object, action string) {
        t0 := time.Now()
        resp, _ := e.Enforce(subject, object, action)
        tElapse := time.Since(t0)
        t.Logf("RESPONSE %-10s %s\t %s : %5v IN: %+v", subject, object, action, resp, tElapse)
        if tElapse > time.Millisecond*100 {
            t.Errorf("More than 100 milliseconds for %s %s %s : %+v", subject, object, action, tElapse)
        }
    }

    request("abu", "/projects/1", "GET")        // really fast because only 2 roles in all policies and at the beginning of the casbin_rule table
    request("abu", "/projects/2499", "GET")     // fast because only 2 roles in all policies
    request("jasmine", "/projects/1", "GET")    // really fast at the beginning of the casbin_rule table

    request("jasmine", "/projects/2499", "GET") // slow and fails the only 1st time   <<<< pb here
    request("jasmine", "/projects/2499", "GET") // fast maybe due to internal cache mechanism

    // same issue with non-existing roles
    // request("jasmine", "/projects/999999", "GET") // slow fails the only 1st time   <<<< pb here
    // request("jasmine", "/projects/999999", "GET") // fast maybe due to internal cache mechanism
}
```

The enforcement time may be very long, up to 6 seconds.

```bash
go test -run ^TestManyRoles$ github.com/casbin/casbin/v2 -v

=== RUN   TestManyRoles
    rbac_api_test.go:598: RESPONSE abu        /projects/1        GET :  true IN: 438.379µs
    rbac_api_test.go:598: RESPONSE abu        /projects/2499     GET :  true IN: 39.005173ms
    rbac_api_test.go:598: RESPONSE jasmine    /projects/1        GET :  true IN: 1.774319ms
    rbac_api_test.go:598: RESPONSE jasmine    /projects/2499     GET :  true IN: 6.164071648s
    rbac_api_test.go:600: More than 100 milliseconds for jasmine /projects/2499 GET : 6.164071648s
    rbac_api_test.go:598: RESPONSE jasmine    /projects/2499     GET :  true IN: 12.164122ms
--- FAIL: TestManyRoles (6.24s)
FAIL
FAIL    github.com/casbin/casbin/v2     6.244s
FAIL
```

However, if we adjust the order of the expressions in matchers and put more time-consuming expressions like functions behind, the execution time will be very short.

Changing the order of expressions in matchers in the above example to:

```ini
[matchers]
m = r.obj == p.obj && g(r.sub, p.sub) && r.act == p.act
```

```bash
go test -run ^TestManyRoles$ github.com/casbin/casbin/v2 -v
=== RUN   TestManyRoles
    rbac_api_test.go:599: RESPONSE abu        /projects/1        GET :  true IN: 786.635µs
    rbac_api_test.go:599: RESPONSE abu        /projects/2499     GET :  true IN: 4.933064ms
    rbac_api_test.go:599: RESPONSE jasmine    /projects/1        GET :  true IN: 2.908534ms
    rbac_api_test.go:599: RESPONSE jasmine    /projects/2499     GET :  true IN: 7.292963ms
    rbac_api_test.go:599: RESPONSE jasmine    /projects/2499     GET :  true IN: 6.168307ms
--- PASS: TestManyRoles (0.05s)
PASS
ok      github.com/casbin/casbin/v2     0.053s
```

## Multiple Section Types

If you need multiple policy definitions or multiple matchers, you can use `p2` or `m2` as examples. In fact, all four sections mentioned above can use multiple types, and the syntax is `r` followed by a number, such as `r2` or `e2`. By default, these four sections should correspond one-to-one. For example, your `r2` section will only use the `m2` matcher to match `p2` policies.

You can pass an `EnforceContext` as the first parameter of the `enforce` method to specify the types. The `EnforceContext` is defined as follows:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="langs">
<TabItem value="Go" label="Go" default>
```

```go
EnforceContext{"r2","p2","e2","m2"}
type EnforceContext struct {
    RType string
    PType string
    EType string
    MType string
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Node.js" label="Node.js">
```

```javascript
const enforceContext = new EnforceContext('r2', 'p2', 'e2', 'm2');
class EnforceContext {
  constructor(rType, pType, eType, mType) {
    this.pType = pType;
    this.eType = eType;
    this.mType = mType;
    this.rType = rType;
  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Java" label="Java">
```

```java
EnforceContext enforceContext = new EnforceContext("2");
public class EnforceContext {
    private String pType;
    private String eType;
    private String mType;
    private String rType;
    public EnforceContext(String suffix) {
      this.pType = "p" + suffix;
      this.eType = "e" + suffix;
      this.mType = "m" + suffix;
      this.rType = "r" + suffix;
    }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Here is an example usage. Please refer to the [model](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/examples/multiple_policy_definitions_model.conf) and [policy](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/examples/multiple_policy_definitions_policy.csv). The request is as follows:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="langs">
<TabItem value="Go" label="Go" default>
```

```go
// Pass in a suffix as a parameter to NewEnforceContext, such as 2 or 3, and it will create r2, p2, etc.
enforceContext := NewEnforceContext("2")
// You can also specify a certain type individually
enforceContext.EType = "e"
// Don't pass in EnforceContext; the default is r, p, e, m
e.Enforce("alice", "data2", "read")        // true
// Pass in EnforceContext
e.Enforce(enforceContext, struct{ Age int }{Age: 70}, "/data1", "read")        //false
e.Enforce(enforceContext, struct{ Age int }{Age: 30}, "/data1", "read")        //true
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Node.js" label="Node.js">
```

```javascript
// Pass in a suffix as a parameter to NewEnforceContext, such as 2 or 3, and it will create r2, p2, etc.
const enforceContext = new NewEnforceContext('2');

// You can also specify a certain type individually
enforceContext.eType = "e"

// Don't pass in EnforceContext; the default is r, p, e, m
e.Enforce("alice", "data2", "read")        // true

// Pass in EnforceContext
e.Enforce(enforceContext, {Age: 70}, "/data1", "read")        //false
e.Enforce(enforceContext, {Age: 30}, "/data1", "read")        //true
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Java" label="Java">
```

```java
// Pass in a suffix as a parameter to NewEnforceContext, such as 2 or 3, and it will create r2, p2, etc.
EnforceContext enforceContext = new EnforceContext("2");
// You can also specify a certain type individually
enforceContext.seteType("e");
// Don't pass in EnforceContext; the default is r, p, e, m
e.enforce("alice", "data2", "read");  // true
// Pass in EnforceContext
// TestEvalRule is located in https://github.com/casbin/jcasbin/blob/master/src/test/java/org/casbin/jcasbin/main/AbacAPIUnitTest.java#L56
e.enforce(enforceContext, new AbacAPIUnitTest.TestEvalRule("alice", 70), "/data1", "read"); // false
e.enforce(enforceContext, new AbacAPIUnitTest.TestEvalRule("alice", 30), "/data1", "read"); // true
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Special Grammar

You could also use the "in" operator, which is the only operator with a text name. This operator checks the array on the right-hand side to see if it contains a value that is equal to the value on the left side. Equality is determined by using the == operator, and this library does not check the types between the values. As long as two values can be cast to interface{} and can still be checked for equality with ==, they will act as expected. Note that you can use a parameter for the array, but it must be an []interface{}.

Also refer to [rbac_model_matcher_using_in_op](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/277c1a2b85698272f764d71a94d2595a8d425915/examples/rbac_model_matcher_using_in_op.conf), [keyget2_model](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/277c1a2b85698272f764d71a94d2595a8d425915/examples/keyget2_model.conf), and [keyget_model](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/277c1a2b85698272f764d71a94d2595a8d425915/examples/keyget_model.conf).

Example:

```ini
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj
...
[matchers]
m = r.sub.Name in (r.obj.Admins)
```

```go
e.Enforce(Sub{Name: "alice"}, Obj{Name: "a book", Admins: []interface{}{"alice", "bob"}})
```

## Expression Evaluator

The matcher evaluation in Casbin is implemented by expression evaluators in each language. Casbin integrates their powers to provide the unified PERM language. In addition to the model syntax provided here, these expression evaluators may offer extra functionality that might not be supported by another language or implementation. Please be cautious when using this functionality.

The expression evaluators used by each Casbin implementation are as follows:

| Implementation | Language | Expression Evaluator                                                                                                                                                                                     |

:::note

If you encounter a performance issue with Casbin, it is likely caused by the low efficiency of the expression evaluator. You can address the issue to Casbin or the expression evaluator directly for advice on speeding up the performance. For more details, please refer to the [Benchmarks](/docs/benchmark) section.
