Some adapters support filtered policy management. This means that the policy loaded by Casbin is a subset of the policy stored in the database, based on a given filter. This allows for efficient policy enforcement in large, multi-tenant environments where parsing the entire policy becomes a performance bottleneck.

To use filtered policies with a supported adapter, call the `LoadFilteredPolicy` method. The valid format for the filter parameter depends on the adapter used. To prevent accidental data loss, the `SavePolicy` method is disabled when a filtered policy is loaded.

For example, the following code snippet uses the built-in filtered file adapter and the RBAC model with domains. In this case, the filter limits the policy to a single domain. Any policy lines for domains other than `"domain1"` are omitted from the loaded policy:
