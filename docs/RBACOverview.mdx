## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) grants permissions to users based on organizational roles. Casbin implements RBAC with flexibility and power.

## RBAC Features in Casbin

Casbin provides comprehensive RBAC support with advanced features:

- **Basic RBAC**: Define role hierarchies and user-role assignments
- **RBAC with Pattern**: Use pattern matching for flexible role assignments
- **RBAC with Domains**: Implement multi-tenancy with domain-specific roles
- **RBAC with Conditions**: Add conditional logic to role-based permissions
- **RBAC96 Compliance**: Compare Casbin RBAC implementation with the NIST RBAC96 standard

## Getting Started

Implement RBAC in Casbin by:

1. Defining role hierarchy in the model configuration
2. Assigning users to roles through policies
3. Using the RBAC API to manage roles and permissions
