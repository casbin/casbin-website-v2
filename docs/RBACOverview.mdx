## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an access control mechanism that assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization. In Casbin, RBAC is a powerful and flexible way to manage user permissions.

## RBAC Features in Casbin

Casbin provides comprehensive support for RBAC with several advanced features:

- **Basic RBAC**: Define role hierarchies and assign users to roles
- **RBAC with Pattern**: Use pattern matching for flexible role assignments
- **RBAC with Domains**: Support multi-tenancy with domain-specific roles
- **RBAC with Conditions**: Add conditional logic to role-based permissions
- **RBAC96 Compliance**: Understand how Casbin RBAC compares to the NIST RBAC96 standard
