## Overview

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** assigns permissions to users according to their roles. Casbin implements RBAC with support for role hierarchies, domains, and conditions.

## RBAC in Casbin

- **Basic RBAC** — Role hierarchies and user–role assignments
- **RBAC with pattern** — Pattern matching for flexible role assignment
- **RBAC with domains** — Multi-tenancy with per-domain roles
- **RBAC with conditions** — Conditional logic in role-based permissions
- **RBAC96** — Alignment with the NIST RBAC96 model

## Getting started

1. Define the role hierarchy and request/policy shape in the [model](/docs/syntax-for-models).
2. Assign users to roles (and optionally resources to roles) in [policy](/docs/policy-storage).
3. Use the [RBAC API](/docs/rbac-api) to manage roles and check permissions.

See the sections below for each variant and implementation details.
