We begin by introducing a Spring Boot example featuring a menu system. This example leverages jCasbin to manage menu permissions. Ultimately, it aims to abstract a middleware, specifically for menu permissions, which could be extended to other languages supported by Casbin, such as Go and Python.

### 1. Configuration Files

You need to set up role and permission management in the `policy.csv` file, along with the parent-child relationships between menu items. For more details, please refer to [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/jcasbin/jcasbin-menu-permission).

#### 1.1 Overview

Using `policy.csv`, you can flexibly configure role permissions and menu structures for fine-grained access control. This configuration file defines access permissions for different roles on various menu items, associations between users and roles, and the hierarchical relationships between menu items.

#### 1.2 Permission Definitions (Policies)

- **Policy Rules**: Policies are defined with a `p` prefix, specifying roles (`sub`) and their permissions (`act`) on menu items (`obj`), along with the rule's effect (`eft`), where `allow` indicates permission is granted, and `deny` indicates it is denied.

Examples:

- `p, ROLE_ROOT, SystemMenu, read, allow` means the `ROLE_ROOT` role has read access to the `SystemMenu` menu item.
- `p, ROLE_ROOT, UserMenu, read, deny` means the `ROLE_ROOT` role is denied read access to the `UserMenu` menu item.

#### 1.3 Roles and User Associations

- **Role Inheritance**: User-role relationships and role hierarchies are defined with a `g` prefix. This allows users to inherit permissions from one or multiple roles.

Examples:

- `g, user, ROLE_USER` means the user `user` is assigned the `ROLE_USER` role.
- `g, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER` means `ROLE_ADMIN` inherits permissions from `ROLE_USER`.

#### 1.4 Menu Item Hierarchy

- **Menu Relationships**: Parent-child relationships between menu items are defined with a `g2` prefix, aiding in the construction of a menu's structure.

Examples:

- `g2, UserSubMenu_allow, UserMenu` indicates `UserSubMenu_allow` is a submenu of `UserMenu`.
- `g2, (NULL), SystemMenu` indicates `SystemMenu` has no submenu item, meaning it is a top-level menu item.

#### 1.5 Menu Permission Inheritance and Default Rules

When managing menu permissions with jCasbin, the permission relationship between parent and child menus follows specific inheritance rules, with two important default rules:

**Inheritance of Parent Menu Permissions**:

If a parent menu is explicitly granted `allow` permission, all its submenus also default to `allow` permission unless specifically marked as `deny`. This means once a parent menu is accessible, its submenus are also accessible by default.

**Handling Parent Menus Without Direct Permission Settings**:

If a parent menu has no direct permission settings (neither explicitly allowed nor denied) but has at least one submenu explicitly granted `allow` permission, then the parent menu is implicitly considered to have `allow` permission. This ensures users can navigate to these submenus.

#### 1.6 Special Permission Inheritance Rules

Regarding the inheritance of permissions between roles, especially in scenarios involving `deny` permissions, the following rules must be followed to ensure system security and precise control of permissions:

**Distinction Between Explicit and Default Denials**:

If a role, such as `ROLE_ADMIN`, is explicitly denied access to a menu item, such as `AdminSubMenu_deny` (marked as `deny`), then even if this role is inherited by another role (e.g., `ROLE_ROOT`), the inheriting role is not permitted access to the denied menu item. This ensures explicit security policies are not bypassed due to role inheritance.

**Inheritance of Default Denial Permissions**:

Conversely, if a role's denial of access to a menu item (e.g., `UserSubMenu_deny`) is default (not explicitly marked as `deny`, but because it was not explicitly granted `allow`), then when this role is inherited by another role (e.g., `ROLE_ADMIN`), the inheriting role may override the default `deny` status, allowing access to these menu items.

#### 1.7 Example Description

policy:

```csv
p, ROLE_ROOT, SystemMenu, read, allow
p, ROLE_ROOT, AdminMenu, read, allow
p, ROLE_ROOT, UserMenu, read, deny
p, ROLE_ADMIN, UserMenu, read, allow
p, ROLE_ADMIN, AdminMenu, read, allow
p, ROLE_ADMIN, AdminSubMenu_deny, read, deny
p, ROLE_USER, UserSubMenu_allow, read, allow

g, user, ROLE_USER
g, admin, ROLE_ADMIN
g, root, ROLE_ROOT
g, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER

g2, UserSubMenu_allow, UserMenu
g2, UserSubMenu_deny, UserMenu
g2, UserSubSubMenu, UserSubMenu_allow
g2, AdminSubMenu_allow, AdminMenu
g2, AdminSubMenu_deny, AdminMenu
g2, (NULL), SystemMenu
```

| MenuName           | ROLE_ROOT | ROLE_ADMIN | ROLE_USER |
|:-------------------|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| SystemMenu         |     ✅     |     ❌      |     ❌     |
| UserMenu           |     ❌     |     ✅      |     ✅     |
| UserSubMenu_allow  |     ❌     |     ✅      |     ✅     |
| UserSubSubMenu     |     ❌     |     ✅      |     ✅     |
| UserSubMenu_deny   |     ❌     |     ✅      |     ❌     |
| AdminMenu          |     ✅     |     ✅      |     ❌     |
| AdminSubMenu_allow |     ✅     |     ✅      |     ❌     |
| AdminSubMenu_deny  |     ✅     |     ❌      |     ❌     |

### 2. Menu Permission Control

The list of all menu items accessible by a given username can be identified through the `findAccessibleMenus()` function available in the [MenuService](https://github.com/jcasbin/jcasbin-menu-permission/blob/master/src/main/java/org/casbin/service/MenuService.java). To check whether a specific user has the rights to access a designated menu item, the `checkMenuAccess()` method can be utilized. This approach ensures that menu permissions are effectively controlled, leveraging jCasbin's capabilities to manage access rights efficiently.
