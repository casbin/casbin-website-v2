## 1. Overview & Documents for Casbin K8s-Gatekeeper

Casbin K8s-GateKeeper is a Kubernetes admission webhook that integrates Casbin as the Access Control tool. By using Casbin K8s-GateKeeper, you can establish flexible rules to authorize or intercept any operation on K8s resources, WITHOUT writing any piece of code, but only several lines of declarative configurations of Casbin models and policies, which are part of the Casbin ACL (Access Control List) language.

Casbin K8s-GateKeeper is developed and maintained by the Casbin community. The repository of this project is available here: [https://github.com/casbin/k8s-gatekeeper](https://github.com/casbin/k8s-gatekeeper)

### 0.1 A Simple Example

For example, you don't need to write any code, but use the following lines of configuration to achieve this function: "Forbid images with some specified tags to be used in any deployments":

Model:

```ini
[request_definition]
r =  obj

[policy_definition]
p =  obj,eft

[policy_effect]
e = !some(where (p.eft == deny))

[matchers]
m = r.obj.Request.Namespace == "default" && r.obj.Request.Resource.Resource =="deployments" && \
contain(split(accessWithWildcard(${OBJECT}.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , "*", "Image"),":",1) , p.obj)
```

And Policy:

```csv
p, "1.14.1",deny
```

These are in ordinary Casbin ACL language. Suppose you have already read chapters about them, it will be very easy to understand.

Casbin K8s-Gatekeeper has the following advantages:

- Easy to use. Writing several lines of ACL is far better than writing lots of code.
- It allows hot updates of configurations. You don't need to shut down the whole plugin to modify configurations.
- It is flexible. Arbitrary rules can be made on any K8s resource, which can be explored with `kubectl gatekeeper`.
- It simplifies the implementation of K8s admission webhook, which is very complicated. You don't need to know what K8s admission webhook is or how to write code for it. All you need to do is to know the resource on which you want to put constraints and then write Casbin ACL. Everyone knows that K8s is complex, but by using Casbin K8s-Gatekeeper, your time can be saved.
- It is maintained by the Casbin community. Feel free to contact us if anything about this plugin confuses you or if you encounter any problems when trying this.

### 1.1 How Casbin K8s-Gatekeeper Works?

K8s-Gatekeeper is an admission webhook for K8s that uses [Casbin](/docs/overview) to apply arbitrary user-defined access control rules to help prevent any operation on K8s that the administrator doesn't want.

Casbin is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library. It provides support for enforcing authorization based on various access control models. For more details about Casbin, see [Overview](/docs/overview).

Admission webhooks in K8s are HTTP callbacks that receive 'admission requests' and do something with them. In particular, K8s-Gatekeeper is a special type of admission webhook: 'ValidatingAdmissionWebhook', which can decide whether to accept or reject this admission request or not. As for admission requests, they are HTTP requests describing an operation on specified resources of K8s (for example, creating/deleting a deployment). For more about admission webhooks, see [K8s official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#what-are-admission-webhooks).

### 1.2 An Example Illustrating How It Works

For example, when somebody wants to create a deployment containing a pod running nginx (using kubectl or K8s clients), K8s will generate an admission request, which (if translated into YAML format) can be something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This request will go through the process of all the middleware shown in the picture, including our K8s-Gatekeeper. K8s-Gatekeeper can detect all the Casbin enforcers stored in K8s's etcd, which is created and maintained by the user (via `kubectl` or the Go client we provide). Each enforcer contains a Casbin model and a Casbin policy. The admission request will be processed by every enforcer, one by one, and only by passing all enforcers can a request be accepted by this K8s-Gatekeeper.

(If you do not understand what a Casbin enforcer, model, or policy is, see this document: [Get Started](/docs/get-started)).

For example, for some reason, the administrator wants to forbid the appearance of the image 'nginx:1.14.1' while allowing 'nginx:1.3.1'. An enforcer containing the following rule and policy can be created (We will explain how to create an enforcer, what these models and policies are, and how to write them in the following chapters).

Model:

```ini
[request_definition]
r =  obj

[policy_definition]
p =  obj,eft

[policy_effect]
e = !some(where (p.eft == deny))

[matchers]
m = r.obj.Request.Namespace == "default" && r.obj.Request.Resource.Resource =="deployments" && \
access(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , 0, "Image") == p.obj

```

Policy:

```csv
p, "nginx:1.13.1",allow
p, "nginx:1.14.1",deny
```

By creating an enforcer containing the model and policy above, the previous admission request will be rejected by this enforcer, which means K8s won't create this deployment.

## 2 Install K8s-gatekeeper

There are three methods available for installing K8s-gatekeeper: External webhook, Internal webhook, and Helm.

:::note
Note: These methods are only meant for users to try out K8s-gatekeeper and are not secure. If you wish to use it in a productive environment, please ensure that you read [Chapter 5. Advanced settings](#5-advanced-settings) and make any necessary modifications before installation.
:::

### 2.1 Internal webhook

#### 2.1.1 Step 1: Build the image

For the internal webhook method, the webhook itself will be implemented as a service within Kubernetes. To create the necessary service and deployment, you need to build an image of K8s-gatekeeper. You can build your own image by running the following command:

```shell
docker build --target webhook -t k8s-gatekeeper .
```

This command will create a local image called 'k8s-gatekeeper:latest'.

:::note
Note: If you are using minikube, please execute `eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)` before running 'docker build'.
:::

#### 2.1.2 Step 2: Set up services and deployments for K8s-gatekeeper

Run the following commands:

```shell
kubectl apply -f config/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/webhook_deployment.yaml 
kubectl apply -f config/webhook_internal.yaml 
```

This will start running K8s-gatekeeper, and you can confirm this by running `kubectl get pods`.

#### 2.1.3 Step 3: Install CRD Resources for K8s-gatekeeper

Run the following commands:

```shell
kubectl apply -f config/auth.casbin.org_casbinmodels.yaml 
kubectl apply -f config/auth.casbin.org_casbinpolicies.yaml
```

### 2.2 External webhook

For the external webhook method, K8s-gatekeeper will be running outside of Kubernetes, and Kubernetes will access K8s-gatekeeper as it would access a regular website. Kubernetes has a mandatory requirement that the admission webhook must be HTTPS. For the purpose of trying out K8s-gatekeeper, we have provided a set of certificates and a private key (although this is not secure). If you prefer to use your own certificate, please refer to [Chapter 5. Advanced settings](#5-advanced-settings) for instructions on adjusting the certificate and private key.

The certificate we provide is issued for 'webhook.domain.local'. So, modify the host (e.g., /etc/hosts) and point 'webhook.domain.local' to the IP address on which K8s-gatekeeper is running.

Then execute the following command:

```shell
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
go run cmd/webhook/main.go
kubectl apply -f config/auth.casbin.org_casbinmodels.yaml 
kubectl apply -f config/auth.casbin.org_casbinpolicies.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/webhook_external.yaml 
```

### 2.3 Install K8s-gatekeeper via Helm

#### 2.3.1 Step 1: Build the image

Please refer to [Chapter 2.1.1](#211-step-1-build-the-image).

#### 2.3.2 Helm installation

Run the command `helm install k8sgatekeeper ./k8sgatekeeper`.

## 3. Try K8s-gatekeeper

### 3.1 Create Casbin Model and Policy

You have two methods to create a model and policy: via kubectl or via the go-client we provide.

#### 3.1.1 Create/Update Casbin Model and Policy via kubectl

In K8s-gatekeeper, the Casbin model is stored in a CRD resource called 'CasbinModel'. Its definition is located in `config/auth.casbin.org_casbinmodels.yaml`.

There are examples in `example/allowed_repo/model.yaml`. Pay attention to the following fields:

- metadata.name: the name of the model. This name MUST be the same as the name of the CasbinPolicy object related to this model, so that K8s-gatekeeper can pair them and create an enforcer.
- spec.enable: if this field is set to "false", this model (as well as the CasbinPolicy object related to this model) will be ignored.
- spec.modelText: a string that contains the model text of a Casbin model.

The Casbin Policy is stored in another CRD resource called 'CasbinPolicy', whose definition can be found in `config/auth.casbin.org_casbinpolicies.yaml`.

There are examples in `example/allowed_repo/policy.yaml`. Pay attention to the following fields:

- metadata.name: the name of the policy. This name MUST be the same as the name of the CasbinModel object related to this policy, so that K8s-gatekeeper can pair them and create an enforcer.
- spec.policyItem: a string that contains the policy text of a Casbin model.
  
After creating your own CasbinModel and CasbinPolicy files, use the following command to apply them:

```shell
kubectl apply -f <filename>
```

Once a pair of CasbinModel and CasbinPolicy is created, K8s-gatekeeper will be able to detect it within 5 seconds.

#### 3.1.2 Create/Update Casbin Model and Policy via the go-client we provide

We understand that there may be situations where it is not convenient to use the shell to execute commands directly on a node of the K8s cluster, such as when you are building an automatic cloud platform for your corporation. Therefore, we have developed a go-client to create and maintain CasbinModel and CasbinPolicy.

The go-client library is located in `pkg/client`.

In `client.go`, we provide a function to create a client.

```go
func NewK8sGateKeeperClient(externalClient bool) (*K8sGateKeeperClient, error) 
```

The `externalClient` parameter determines whether K8s-gatekeeper is running inside the K8s cluster or not.

In `model.go`, we provide various functions to create, delete, and modify CasbinModel. You can find out how to use these interfaces in `model_test.go`.

In `policy.go`, we provide various functions to create, delete, and modify CasbiPolicy. You can find out how to use these interfaces in `policy_test.go`.

### 3.1.2 Try Whether K8s-gatekeeper Works

Suppose you have already created the exact model and policy in `example/allowed_repo`. Now, try the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f example/allowed_repo/testcase/reject_1.yaml
```

You should find that K8s will reject this request and mention that the webhook was the reason why this request is rejected. However, when you try to apply `example/allowed_repo/testcase/approve_2.yaml`, it will be accepted.

## 4. How to Write Model and Policy with K8s-gatekeeper

First of all, make sure you are familiar with the basic grammar of Casbin Models and Policies. If you are not, please read the [Get Started](/docs/get-started) section first. In this chapter, we assume that you already understand what Casbin Models and Policies are.

### 4.1 Request Definition of Model

When K8s-gatekeeper is authorizing a request, the input is always an object: the Go object of the Admission Request. This means that the enforcer will always be used like this:

```go
ok, err := enforcer.Enforce(admission)
```

where `admission` is an `AdmissionReview` object defined by K8s's official go api `"k8s.io/api/admission/v1"`. You can find the definition of this struct in this repository: [https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/master/admission/v1/types.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/master/admission/v1/types.go). For more information, you can also refer to [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#webhook-request-and-response](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#webhook-request-and-response).

Therefore, for any model used by K8s-gatekeeper, the definition of the `request_definition` should always be like this:

```ini
    [request_definition]
    r =  obj
```

The name 'obj' is not mandatory, as long as the name is consistent with the name used in the `[matchers]` part.

### 4.2 Matchers of Model

You are supposed to use the ABAC feature of Casbin to write your rules. However, the expression evaluator integrated in Casbin does not support indexing in maps or arrays(slices), nor the expansion of arrays. Therefore, K8s-gatekeeper provides various 'Casbin functions' as extensions to implement these features. If you still find that your demand cannot be fulfilled by these extensions, feel free to start an issue, or create a pull request.

If you are not familiar with Casbin functions, you can refer to [Function](/docs/function) for more information.

Here are the extension functions:

### 4.2.1 Extension functions

#### 4.2.1.1 access

Access is used to solve the problem that Casbin does not support indexing in maps or arrays. The example `example/allowed_repo/model.yaml` demonstrates the usage of this function:

```ini
[matchers]
m = r.obj.Request.Namespace == "default" && r.obj.Request.Resource.Resource =="deployments" && \
access(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , 0, "Image") == p.obj
```

In this matcher, `access(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , 0, "Image")` is equivalent to `r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers[0].Image`, where `r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers` is a slice.

Access can also call simple functions that have no parameters and return a single value. The example `example/container_resource_limit/model.yaml` demonstrates this:

```ini
[matchers]
  m = r.obj.Request.Namespace == "default" && r.obj.Request.Resource.Resource =="deployments" && \
  parseFloat(access(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , 0, "Resources","Limits","cpu","Value")) >= parseFloat(p.cpu) && \
  parseFloat(access(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , 0, "Resources","Limits","memory","Value")) >= parseFloat(p.memory)
```

In this matcher, `access(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , 0, "Resources","Limits","cpu","Value")` is equivalent to `r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers[0].Resources.Limits["cpu"].Value()`, where `r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers[0].Resources.Limits` is a map, and `Value()` is a simple function that has no parameters and returns a single value.

#### 4.2.1.2 accessWithWildcard

Sometimes, you may have a demand like this: all elements in an array must have a prefix "aaa". However, Casbin does not support `for` loops. With `accessWithWildcard` and the "map/slice expansion" feature, you can easily implement such a demand.

For example, suppose `a.b.c` is an array `[aaa,bbb,ccc,ddd,eee]`, then the result of `accessWithWildcard(a,"b","c","*")` will be a slice `[aaa,bbb,ccc,ddd,eee]`. By using the wildcard `*`, the slice is expanded.

Similarly, the wildcard can be used more than once. For example, the result of `accessWithWildcard(a,"b","c","*","*")` will be `[a.b.c[0][0], a.b.c[0][1], ..., a.b.c[1][0], a.b.c[1][1], ...]`.

### 4.2.1.3 Functions Supporting Variable-length Arguments

In the expression evaluator of Casbin, when a parameter is an array, it will be automatically expanded as a variable-length argument. Utilizing this feature to support array/slice/map expansion, we have also integrated several functions that accept an array/slice as a parameter:

- contain(): accepts multiple parameters and returns whether any parameter (except the last parameter) equals the last parameter.
- split(a,b,c...,sep,index): returns a slice that contains `[splits(a,sep)[index], splits(b,sep)[index], splits(a,sep)[index], ...]`.
- len(): returns the length of the variable-length argument.
- matchRegex(a,b,c...,regex): returns whether all of the given parameters (`a`, `b`, `c`, ...) match the given regex.

Here is an example in `example/disallowed_tag/model.yaml`:

```ini
    [matchers]
    m = r.obj.Request.Namespace == "default" && r.obj.Request.Resource.Resource =="deployments" && \
    contain(split(accessWithWildcard(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , "*", "Image"),":",1) , p.obj)
```

Assuming that `accessWithWildcard(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , "*", "Image")` returns `["a:b", "c:d", "e:f", "g:h"]`, because splits supports variable-length arguments and performs the splits operation on each element, the element at index 1 will be selected and returned. Therefore, `split(accessWithWildcard(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , "*", "Image"),":",1)` returns `["b","d","f","h"]`. And `contain(split(accessWithWildcard(r.obj.Request.Object.Object.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers , "*", "Image"),":",1) , p.obj)` returns whether `p.obj` is contained in `["b","d","f","h"]`.

#### 4.2.1.2 Type Conversion Functions

- ParseFloat(): Parses an integer to a float (this is necessary because any number used in comparison must be converted into a float).
- ToString(): Converts an object to a string. This object must have a basic type of string (for example, an object of type `XXX` when there is a statement `type XXX string`).
- IsNil(): Returns whether the parameter is nil.

## 5. Advanced Settings

### 5.1 About Certificates

In Kubernetes (k8s), it is mandatory that a webhook should use HTTPS. There are two approaches to achieve this:

- Use self-signed certificates (examples in this repository use this method)
- Use a normal certificate

#### 5.1.1 Self-signed certificates

Using a self-signed certificate means that the Certificate Authority (CA) issuing the certificate is not one of the well-known CAs. Therefore, you must let k8s know about this CA.

Currently, the example in this repository uses a self-made CA, whose private key and certificate are stored in `config/certificate/ca.crt` and `config/certificate/ca.key` respectively. The certificate for the webhook is `config/certificate/server.crt`, which is issued by the self-made CA. The domains of this certificate are "webhook.domain.local" (for external webhook) and "casbin-webhook-svc.default.svc" (for internal webhook).

Information about the CA is passed to k8s via webhook configuration files. Both `config/webhook_external.yaml` and `config/webhook_internal.yaml` have a field called "CABundle", which contains a base64 encoded string of the CA's certificate.

In case you need to change the certificate/domain (for example, if you want to put this webhook into another namespace of k8s while using an internal webhook, or if you want to change the domain while using an external webhook), the following procedures should be followed:

1. Generate a new CA:

   - Generate the private key for the fake CA:

     ```shell
     openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 2048
     ```

   - Remove the password protection of the private key:

     ``` shell
     openssl rsa -in ca.key -out ca.key
     ```

2. Generate a private key for the webhook server:

   ```shell
   openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048
   openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key
   ```

3. Use the self-generated CA to sign the certificate for the webhook:

   - Copy your system's openssl config file for temporary use. You can find out the location of the config file by running `openssl version -a`, usually called `openssl.cnf`.

   - In the config file:
     - Find the `[req]` paragraph and add the following line: `req_extensions = v3_req`
     - Find the `[v3_req]` paragraph and add the following line: `subjectAltName = @alt_names`
     - Append the following lines to the file:

       ```ini
       [alt_names]
       DNS.2=<The domain you want>
       ```

       Note: Replace 'casbin-webhook-svc.default.svc' with the real service name of your own service if you decide to modify the service name.

   - Use the modified config file to generate a certificate request file:

     ```shell
     openssl req -new -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr -config openssl.cnf
     ```

   - Use the self-made CA to respond to the request and sign the certificate:

     ```shell
     openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -out server.crt -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -extensions v3_req -extensions SAN -extfile openssl.cnf
     ```

4. Replace the 'CABundle' field:
   Both `config/webhook_external.yaml` and `config/webhook_internal.yaml` have a field called "CABundle", which contains a base64 encoded string of the certificate of the CA. Update this field with the new certificate.

5. If you are using helm, similar changes need to be applied to the helm charts.

#### 5.1.2 Legal certificates

If you use legal certificates, you do not need to go through all these procedures. Remove the "CABundle" field in `config/webhook_external.yaml` and `config/webhook_internal.yaml`, and change the domain in these files to the domain you own.
