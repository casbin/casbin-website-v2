When using Casbin in a multi-threading environment, you can employ the synchronized wrapper of the Casbin enforcer: [https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/enforcer_synced.go](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/enforcer_synced.go) (GoLang) and [https://github.com/casbin/casbin-cpp/blob/master/casbin/enforcer_synced.cpp](https://github.com/casbin/casbin-cpp/blob/master/casbin/enforcer_synced.cpp) (C++).

Furthermore, it also provides support for the "AutoLoad" feature, allowing the Casbin enforcer to automatically load the latest policy rules from the database if any changes occur. To initiate the automatic loading of policies periodically, call the "StartAutoLoadPolicy()" function. Likewise, to stop this automatic loading, call the "StopAutoLoadPolicy()" function.
