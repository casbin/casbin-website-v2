## Overview

The **Biba** model (1975) enforces **integrity**: subjects and objects have integrity levels. Rules: **no read down** (don’t read lower-integrity data), **no write up** (don’t write to higher-integrity data). So high-integrity data cannot be corrupted by lower-integrity sources.

## Model

```conf
[request_definition]
r = sub, sub_level, obj, obj_level, act

[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

[role_definition]
g = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = (r.act == "read" && r.sub_level <= r.obj_level) || (r.act == "write" && r.sub_level >= r.obj_level)
```

## Policy

Usually no `p` rules; the matcher implements Biba from request levels:

- **No Read Down (Simple Integrity Property)**: Subjects cannot read objects with lower integrity levels
- **No Write Up (Star Integrity Property)**: Subjects cannot write to objects with higher integrity levels

## Core Principles

Biba's "read up, write down" approach inverts Bell-LaPadula's "read down, write up" model. This ensures:

1. **Data Integrity Protection**: Prevents high-integrity data corruption from lower-integrity sources
2. **Controlled Information Flow**: Limits writes to flow from higher to lower integrity levels only
3. **Trust Preservation**: Maintains data trustworthiness at each integrity level

## Examples

### Request Examples

```text
alice, 3, data1, 1, read    # alice (level 3) reads data1 (level 1) - DENIED (No Read Down)
bob, 2, data2, 2, read      # bob (level 2) reads data2 (level 2) - ALLOWED
charlie, 1, data1, 1, read  # charlie (level 1) reads data1 (level 1) - ALLOWED
bob, 2, data3, 3, read      # bob (level 2) reads data3 (level 3) - ALLOWED
charlie, 1, data2, 2, read  # charlie (level 1) reads data2 (level 2) - ALLOWED

alice, 3, data3, 3, write   # alice (level 3) writes data3 (level 3) - ALLOWED
bob, 2, data3, 3, write     # bob (level 2) writes data3 (level 3) - DENIED (No Write Up)
charlie, 1, data2, 2, write # charlie (level 1) writes data2 (level 2) - DENIED (No Write Up)
alice, 3, data1, 1, write   # alice (level 3) writes data1 (level 1) - ALLOWED
bob, 2, data1, 1, write     # bob (level 2) writes data1 (level 1) - ALLOWED
```

## Integrity Levels

Biba represents integrity levels as integers where higher values indicate greater integrity:

- Level 1: Low integrity (public data, user-generated content)
- Level 2: Medium integrity (verified data, trusted sources)
- Level 3: High integrity (system data, administrative content)
- Level 4: Critical integrity (security policies, system configuration)

## Use Cases

Common Biba model applications:

- Financial systems requiring data accuracy
- Healthcare records management
- Database systems requiring data integrity
- Environments where preventing data corruption outweighs preventing disclosure
- Systems where information accuracy and reliability are critical

## Implementation Notes

- Enforces mandatory access control (MAC) focused on integrity
- System administrators assign integrity levels based on data trustworthiness
- Access decisions depend on integrity levels rather than user identity
- Prevents data corruption through controlled read/write operations
- Unlike Bell-LaPadula, most Biba implementations use few integrity levels

## Comparison with Bell-LaPadula

| Aspect        | Bell-LaPadula         | Biba                  |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Primary Focus | Confidentiality       | Integrity             |
| Read Rule     | No Read Up            | No Read Down          |
| Write Rule    | No Write Down         | No Write Up           |
| Phrase        | "Read down, write up" | "Read up, write down" |
