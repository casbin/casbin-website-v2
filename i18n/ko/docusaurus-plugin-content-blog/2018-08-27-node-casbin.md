Today, we successfully ported Casbin to Node.js, which is named as: [node-Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/node-casbin).

**node-Casbin** shares the similar usage and API with other implementations of Casbin. The middlewares for Express, Koa2 and Egg.js are ready to use. The storage adapter for Sequelize is also prepared.

Hope it can serve your need well :)
