## Role definition with domains tenants

The RBAC roles in Casbin can be global or domain-specific. Domain-specify roles mean that the roles for a user can be different when the user is at different domains/tenants. This is very useful for large systems like a cloud, as the users are usually in different tenants.

The role definition with domains/tenants should be something like:

```ini
[role_definition]
g = _, _, _
```

The 3rd `_` means the name of domain/tenant, this part should not be changed. Then the policy can be:

```
p, admin, tenant1, data1, read
p, admin, tenant2, data2, read

g, alice, admin, tenant1
g, alice, user, tenant2
```

It means `admin` role in `tenant1` can read `data1`. And `alice` has `admin` role in `tenant1`, and has `user` role in `tenant2`. So she can read `data1`. However, since `alice` is not an `admin` in `tenant2`, she cannot read `data2`.

Then in a matcher, you should check the role as below:

```ini
[matchers]
m = g(r.sub, p.sub, r.dom) && r.dom == p.dom && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
```

Please see the [rbac_with_domains_model.conf](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/examples/rbac_with_domains_model.conf) for examples.

:::info Token name convention

Note: Conventionally domain token name in policy definition is `dom` and placed as the second token(`sub, dom, obj, act`). Now Golang Casbin supports customized token name & place. If the domain token name is `dom`, the domain token can be placed at an arbitrary place and no extra action needs.  If the domain token name is not `dom` , `e.SetFieldIndex()` for `constant.DomainIndex` should be called after the enforcer is initialized regardless of its position.

```ini
# `domain` here for `dom`
[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act, domain
```

```go
e.SetFieldIndex("p", constant.DomainIndex, 3) // index start from 0
users := e.GetAllUsersByDomain("domain1") // without SetFieldIndex, it will raise an error
```
