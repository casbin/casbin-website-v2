You can also use the [online editor](/editor) to write your Casbin model and policy in your web browser. 프로그래밍 언어를 위한 통합 개발 환경(IDE) 처럼 `구문 강조(syntax highlighting)` 및 `코드 자동 완성(code completion)` 기능을 제공합니다.

## Use Pattern
If you use `RBAC with pattern` or `RBAC with all pattern`, it specifies the pattern matching function in the lower left corner.

![editor-tips](/img/editor-tips.png).

If you want to write the equivalent code, you need to specify the pattern matching function through the relevant api. See [RBAC with Pattern](/docs/rbac-with-pattern)

:::note

The editor is based on [node-casbin](https://github.com/casbin/node-casbin). Due to the synchronization delay between different language of casbin, the authentication result of the `editor` may be different from the authentication result of the casbin you are using. If so, please submit issues to the casbin repository you are using.
