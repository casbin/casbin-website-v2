If you use Casbin in a multi-threading manner, you can use the synchronized wrapper of the Casbin enforcer: https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/enforcer_synced.go (GoLang) and https://github.com/casbin/casbin-cpp/blob/master/casbin/enforcer_synced.cpp (C++).

It also supports the `AutoLoad` feature, which means the Casbin enforcer will automatically load the latest policy rules from DB if it has changed. Call `StartAutoLoadPolicy()` to start automatically loading policy periodically and call `StopAutoLoadPolicy()` to stop it.
