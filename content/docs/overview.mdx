Casbin is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library that supports various
[access control models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control#Access_control_models)
for enforcing authorization across the board.

Enforcing a set of rules is as simple as listing subjects, objects, and the desired allowed action (or any other format as per your needs) in a **_policy_** file. This is synonymous across all flows in which Casbin is used. The developer/administrator has complete control over the layout, execution, and conditions for authorization, which are set via the **_model_** file. Casbin provides an **_Enforcer_** for validating an incoming request based on the policy and model files given to the Enforcer.

## Languages Supported by Casbin

Casbin provides support for various programming languages, ready to be integrated within any project and workflow.
